# Mouse Jitter Utility

The Mouse Jitter Utility is a simple application that adds random mouse movements to simulate user activity. It can be useful for various purposes, such as preventing screen lock or keeping an application active.

## Current Features

- Toggle mouse jittering with a hotkey combination (default: Shift + J).
- Customize the minimum and maximum distance for mouse jittering.
- Smooth movement transitions for a more natural effect.
- Application settings are saved for future sessions.

## Planned Features

- **Customizable Jitter Patterns:** Instead of purely random jitter, allow users to define custom patterns or presets for the mouse movements. For example, users could specify a specific sequence of mouse movements or create a custom path for the mouse to follow.
- **Timing and Intensity Settings:** Provide options for users to adjust the timing and intensity of the mouse jitter. They could specify the frequency of movements, the duration of pauses between movements, or the overall intensity of the jitter effect.
- ~~**Smooth Transition Effects:** Implement smooth transitions between mouse positions to make the jittering appear more natural. This can be achieved by using easing functions or interpolations to generate smoother movement trajectories.~~ Released!
- **Randomized Mouse Clicks:** In addition to mouse movement, incorporate random mouse clicks to further simulate user activity. This could involve clicking at random positions or within a predefined region.
- **Configurable Hotkeys:** Allow users to customize the hotkeys used to start and stop the jittering. This would provide flexibility for users who may prefer different key combinations.
- **Tray Icon and Notifications:** Add a system tray icon and provide notifications or tooltips to indicate the status of the jittering program. This would make it easier for users to control and monitor the application from the system tray.
